# Reason #
I had been looking around for a simple multicast project for a while and had seen code snippets and some projects on CodeProject but nothing really suited my needs. I decided to write a simple library that I would be able to learn from in the .Net environment.

# Goal #
Provide a very simple multicast Broadcaster and Listener for asynchronous multicast message sending.

# Project Details #
The project was developed in Visual Studio. This is my first project that is open source. I hope people find it useful and I welcome any comments and feedback.
